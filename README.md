**Description**
* Only controller support has been tested
* Uses Goldberg and Nemirting
* Works for controllers. Fixed:~~[(Joining the lobby is difficult)](73b5c46287e833239a2c4c7d78193afd3484b771)~~
* Fixed: ~~[No 2nd player profile saves](https://github.com/Gtt1229/coralislandNucleus/commit/1f707fea8c7e12e828d437ec6d3ddda8c0bbcb11#commitcomment-151197712)~~
* Steam must be closed to prevent controller stealing

**Notes**
* Cursor may duplicate accross both instances. Lock input and then unlock input to remediate.

**Issues**
* Fixed: ~~[If the emulated Steam Overlay is launched, you will not be able to close the overlay.](https://github.com/Gtt1229/coralislandNucleus/commit/1f707fea8c7e12e828d437ec6d3ddda8c0bbcb11#commitcomment-151197712)~~
* Fixed: ~~[Navigating the menu is difficult as the simulated cursor does not show, so navigating is unintuitive](73b5c46287e833239a2c4c7d78193afd3484b771)~~
