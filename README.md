**Description**
* Only controller support has been tested
* Uses Goldberg and Nemirting
* Works for controllers (Joining the lobby is difficult)
* No 2nd player profile saves
* Steam must be closed to prevent controller stealing

**Issues**
* Navigating the menu is difficult as the simulated cursor does not show, so navigating is unintuitive
* If the emulated Steam Overlay is launched, you will not be able to close the overlay.
